<p> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. </p>

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

<h3> Example 1: </h3>

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

<hr>

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 <h3> Constraints: </h3>
 
<hr>

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists
